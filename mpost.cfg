% MsgPost/2 Version 2.0 -- Configuration File
%
% Unix users, if you are annoyed by the ^M characers, you can use
%     cat mpost.cfg | tr -d \\\r  > new.cfg
% to remove them, but mpost will work even if the ^M characters are in this
% file. Source code maintainers, please leave the carriage
% returns in this file for the comfort of Windows and DOS users!
%
% Valid comment characters are '%' and ';'. Note that ALL configuration
% commands contained within this file are also valid if entered at the
% top of the source text file. In that case, they will override entries
% in this configuration file. All configuration verbs are case insensitive.
%

        % Address: [Zone:]Net/Node[.Point][@Domain]
        % The 'Address:' command tells MsgPost your system network
        % address. This is required for all MsgPost functions. The
        % created message origin address defaults to this system
        % address. Use the -O command line option to override with a
        % different origin address, for multi-network operation, etc.
        % Full 5D addressing is supported. 3:690/613 3:690/613.13, and
        % 3:690/613.13@fidonet are all valid entries.

        Address:        2:292/608.18


        % Origin: <Your system echomail identification>
        % Echomail origin line. This is not required or used for netmail
        % or local messages. For echomail format (the default output
        % method), MsgPost uses the configuration origin entry from
        % either this configuration file, or from the optional
        % configuration allowed at the top of the source text file. If
        % neither of these is found, MsgPost attempts to locate the
        % Origin file from the message area. For *.Msg areas, this file
        % is called 'ORIGIN.' in the message directory. For Squish
        % format areas, the name is 'BASENAME.SQO', where 'BASENAME' is
        % the name of the Squish message base. If the file is not found,
        % a default Origin entry is used.

        Origin:         Welplin's Lair * +32-16-237235 * 23:00-03:00


        % Area: <Message area path & name>
        % Message area path. Indicate a Squish format area by using a
        % leading '$'character, and use a leading '!' for JAM.
        % This is the path, and for Squish and JAM areas
        % the name of the message base, into which MsgPost will write
        % the generated messages. Only one entry or area is supported.

        % Area:         d:\msg\net
        Area:         $f:\msgbase\test


        % Netmail: [Zone:]Net/Node[.Point][@Domain]
        % The 'Netmail:' option tells MsgPost to create the generated
        % message(s) in Netmail format, and specifies the destination
        % address. 5d addresses are supported.

        Netmail:      3:632/348


        % MsgType: <Echomail | Conference | Local | Matrix>
        % 'MsgType: <Type>' specifies the type of message to create.
        % Available types are Echomail, Conference, Local, and Matrix.
        % Echomail is the default type when nothing is specified. The
        % Conference type is similar to Echomail, but uses a PID kludge
        % line and no tear or Origin line in the generated message.
        % Local messages are also similar to Echomail, without the
        % Origin and SeenBy lines or PID kludge line. Matrix is the netmail
        % format, also activated by providing a netmail destination
        % address, via either the 'Netmail:' configuration verb or the
        % -N command line option.

        % MsgType:      Echomail
        % MsgType:      Conference
        %  MsgType:      Local
        MsgType:      Matrix


        % To: <Some Name>
        % The 'To:' command gives MsgPost the To: field for the
        % generated message(s). This command is not required, the default
        % is to "All". For List mode this field is ignored.

        To:             All


        % From: <Your Name>
        % The 'From:' option indicated the message(s) From: field. Also
        % not required, the default being "MsgPost v1.05".

        From:           MsgPost


        % Subj: <Your Subject>
        % 'Subj:' is the option that tells MsgPost the generated
        % message(s) subject line. Not required, the default is
        % "Automated Posting".

        Subj:           Automated Posting


        % Attr: <c|f|h|d|k|p|r|u|l>
        % The 'Attr:' option enables setting of most of the generated
        % message(s) attributes. These include c,f,h,d,k,p,r,u, and l.
        % See the Document file for details.

        Attr:         p


        % FakeNet: <###>
        % The 'FakeNet:' option specifies the fakenet for point systems.
        % Normally not a requirement for 4D points, this may reduce
        % problems with MsgPost's default SEENBY addition. See also the
        % 'NoSeenBy:' configuration option.

        % FakeNet:      6130


        % NoSeenBy:
        % The 'NoSeenBy:' command turns off the addition of a SEENBY
        % line listing the message origin address, for Echomail messages.

        % NoSeenBy:


        % Split: <###>
        % Same as the -S command line option, 'Split: <###>' sets the
        % maximum message size in Kilobytes for message splitting. Range
        % is from 0 to 16. Using a value of zero turns off splitting, in
        % which case MsgPost loads up to 16Kb from the input text file,
        % ignoring any extra text from the file. The default split
        % maximum is 12Kb, a value which is probably safe with most
        % today's existing mail processers. Recommended setting is 8Kb,
        % producing split messages to 8Kb in size each.

        Split: 8

        % Charset: <###>
        % Specify the character set kludge that is appropriate. If your text
        % files contain DOS or OS/2 style umlauts or other national special
        % characters, or IBM block graphics, use IBMPC. If your text files
        % contain Windows-style "ANSI" or Unix-style "ISO 8859-1" umlauts,
        % use LATIN-1. Russian users, use "CP866".

        Charset: IBMPC
