0. What's new in this version
-----------------------------

Mpost 1.21 is 100% identical to Mpost 1.20, except for the fact that it has
been linked against a Y2K safe version of the message API, while the one
that had been used for 1.20 turned out to be not Y2K safe.

There is no NT/alpha executable any more, because I don't have any NT
installation on DEC Alpha any more. If you need MPost on NT/alpha, please
contact me and we will find a solution.

1. About MsgPost and the current status
---------------------------------------

Mpost is a program to post a text file as netmail and echomail message into
a Squish or *.MSG style message area from command line.  It is useful in
shell or REXX scripts or batch files for system maintanance purposes, like
posting a monthly echomail statistics, posting rules files, or similar
tasks.

Mpost is (C) by Codeland Australia and has been written by Colin Wheat,
originally for OS/2 only.  The last release of MPost before this version
was MPost 1.10.  The exact license status of MPost is questionable; but it
seem sot be freeware as its source code is available.  I decided to leave
in the Codeland Copyright statement.

In 1999, I (Tobias Ernst) have done some modifications to this source code.
Year 2000 bugs had to be fixed, I added a way to add FTSC 0054 charset
kludges to the posted mails, and I ported the software to Unix, NT and DPMI
DOS.  In order to make the public profit from these changes (especially the
Y2K one), I hereby release these modifications to the public, both the
source code and binaries for all relevant platforms.

If you are already using Mpost and only want to have the Y2K upgrade,
simply copy the provided executables over your current ones, they should
work immediately with the old configuration file.

I do NOT intend to further work on this code, except for bugfixes.  If
anybody wants to do changes on the code and release a new version, I can
offer my help in compiling the source code for all platforms that the
prospective programmer might not have avialable, i.E. I offer to produce
binaries and resolve porting issues.  But I definitely will not start to work
on the code on my own for adding new features or similar, unless I need
them personally.  So consider this a frozen release until the sime that
some other person picks up the code.  I have submitted the code the the
Husky project, so maybe there will be some development going on, like
fidoconfig adaption or simlar.  View the Husky project site at
http://husky.sar-gmbh.com for more information.

2. Using MPost
--------------

You can use one of the following executables:

MPOSTP.EXE     -- OS/2 32 Bit standalone executable
MPOSTNTI.EXE   -- Windows 32 Bit executable for Windows 95/98/NT on Intel CPUs
MPOST32.EXE    -- DOS executable. Requires an DPMI memory manager.
MPOSTLNX       -- Linux executable, dynamically linked against libc.5.4.23

The source code will also compile on most other Unix systems, see below.

The following list shows all command line and configuration file options.
It is all documentation that is available for the code, and I do not intend
to write more.  It is enough to get it running, anyway.  For a more
detailed description, also refer to mpost.cfg, the sample configuration
file, which also contains some helpful remarks.

Note that you always need a configuration file for Msgpost, even though you
can in theory specify all options via command line.

3. Mpost and the charset kludge
-------------------------------

The FTSC 0054 charset kludge is a means to use national special characters
(ASCII 128 to 254) in Fidonet mails. The charset kludge is a sign that tells
mail readers in which character set the mails hass been written, so that they
can recode the mail to the character set that the operating system / terminal
of the receiver is using.

Mpost does not include logic for charcter set kludges. All it can do is
insert a level 2 character set, but you have to tell it which one. The rule
of the thumb is:

If the text file that you are posting uses special characters as used by DOS
and OS/2, especially umlauts and IBM graphics characters (IBM graphics is
often used by statistics generators to produce nicer borders), use either the
configuration file statement

   Charset: IBMPC

or the "-hIBMPC" command line option. If you are using Windows or UNIX, it is
most likely that your umlauts comply to ISO 8859-1. In this case, use

   Charset: LATIN-1

or the "-hLATIN-1" command line option. (Windows calls this ANSI,
and uses it for the Times New Roman, Courier New etc. fonts, though not for
the terminal window; Unix calls this ISO 8859-1 keymap, though some Linux
boxes can also be configured to use CP850 or CP437 instead, which would be
the same as IBMPC).

4. MSGID considerations
-----------------------

For MSGID uniqueness reasons, the UNIX and DOS versions of MPost can only
create one message per second.  The OS/2 and Win32 versions can create up
to 100 messages per second.  MPOST will enforce the necessary delays, so
you do not have to bother, it is only that MPOST might seem somewhat slow
on UNIX and DOS because of this problem.

5. Hints on compiling Mpost
---------------------------

Compiling Mpost requires the SMAPI source code. You can get it from
www.tichy.de, ftp://ftp.sar-gmbh.com/pub/freeware/husky, or by requesting
the magic SMAPI from 2:2432/645 or 2:2476/418. Place the smapi and Mpost in
separate subdirectories at the same level, i.E. to c:\source\smapi and
c:\source\mpost, respectively. Then compile a SMAPI for your operating
system. If you have problems, the Msged TE manual contains exhaustive
information on how to do this.

After that, use one of the makefiles that come with Mpost:

  makefile.rxw   -- for compiling with the EMX RSX/NT compiler for Win95/98/NT
  makefile.mgw   -- for compiling with the Mingw32 compiler for Win95/98/NT
  makefile.emo   -- for compiling with the EMX compiler for OS/2
  makefile.ibo   -- for compiling with IBM CSet/2 for OS/2
  makefile.djg   -- for compiling with the DJGPP compiler for DOS
  makefile.unx   -- for compiling with any "cc" compiler on Unix/Linux/...
  husky.lnx      -- for compiling in the Husky build environment
