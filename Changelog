Mpost 2.0
- Mpost now supports JAM areas. Use a ! in front of the area path (like you
  use $ for squish areas), e.g.: !e:\msgbase\linux
- Patch for reading text from stdin (use "-" as text file name) from Dmitry
  Sergienko.
- Mpost no longer requires a configuration file if you specify everything
  as command line arguments. Only a warning message is issued now.

Mpost 1.22 fixes a bug that crept into MPOST32.EXE (32 Bit DOS version):  The
message number of *.MSG messages was always 1 (or any other fixed number)
instead of the highest non-used message number.  This could lead to Mpost
overwriting other mails.  Please do not use MPOST32.EXE 1.21 any more.  The
executables for all other platforms are not affected.

Mpost 1.21 is identical to Mpost 1.20, except for the fact that it has
been linked against a Y2K safe version of the message API, while the one
that had been used for 1.20 turned out to be not Y2K safe.

There is no NT/alpha executable any more, because I don't have any NT
installation on DEC Alpha any more. If you need MPost on NT/alpha, please
contact me and we will find a solution.

Also, the buffer size for a message line has been raised from 256 characters
to 4096 characters, allowing you to post in a paragraph-oriented way instead
of line-oriented.
